    # Here we define some context values which often change between host
    # computers, and are therefore practical to use in our templates.
    displays:
        # All displays defined here are used in the polybar module. It creates
        # one bar for each of the display handles, where the bar identifier is
        # the same as the display handle. This way you can start a polybar for
        # the primary screen by running:
        #     polybar --config {modules/polybar/config.template} HDMI2
        primary:
            handle: HDMI1

        wlan:
            # You can also use command substitution in order to insert the
            # standard output of a shell command into a configuration option.
            #
            # This is also used by the polybar template to point the
            # wireless-internet polybar module to the correct interface.
