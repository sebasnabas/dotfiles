    # Here we define some context values which often change between host
    # computers, and are therefore practical to use in our templates.
    displays:
        # All displays defined here are used in the polybar module. It creates
        # one bar for each of the display handles, where the bar identifier is
        # the same as the display handle. This way you can start a polybar for
        # the primary screen by running:
        #     polybar --config {modules/polybar/config.template} HDMI2
        primary:
            handle: HDMI1
